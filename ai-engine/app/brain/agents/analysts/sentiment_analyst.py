"""Sentiment analyst — multi-source sentiment analysis for a target ticker.

Previously named ``social_media_analyst``. Renamed and redesigned because
the old version had a prompt that demanded social-media analysis but the
only tool available was Yahoo Finance news — which led LLMs to fabricate
Reddit/X/StockTwits content under prompt pressure (verified live).

The redesigned agent pre-fetches two complementary data sources before
the LLM is invoked and injects them into the prompt as structured blocks:

  1. StockTwits messages — retail-trader posts indexed by cashtag, with
                           user-labeled Bullish/Bearish sentiment tags
  2. Reddit posts        — r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing

The agent does not use tool-calling; the data is in the prompt from
turn 0. The LLM produces the sentiment report in a single invocation.

## Data sources (pre-fetched, in this prompt)

### StockTwits messages — retail-trader social platform indexed by cashtag
Fast-moving signal. Each message carries a user-labeled sentiment tag (Bullish / Bearish / no-label) plus the message body.

<start_of_stocktwits>
{stocktwits_block}
<end_of_stocktwits>

### Reddit posts — r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing (past 7 days)
Community discussion. Engagement signal via upvote score and comment count. Subreddit character matters (r/wallstreetbets is often contrarian/exuberant; r/stocks more measured; r/investing longer-term).

<start_of_reddit>
{reddit_block}
<end_of_reddit>

## How to analyze this data (best practices)

1. **Read the StockTwits Bullish/Bearish ratio as a leading retail-sentiment signal.** A 70/30 bullish/bearish split is moderately bullish; ≥90/10 may indicate over-extension and contrarian risk; 50/50 is uncertainty. Sample size matters — base rates on the actual message count, not percentages alone.

2. **Weight Reddit posts by engagement.** A 400-upvote / 200-comment thread reflects community attention; a 3-upvote post is noise. Read the body excerpts for context — the title alone often misleads.

3. **Identify recurring narrative themes.** What topic keeps coming up across sources? That's the dominant narrative driving current sentiment.

4. **Be honest about data limits.** If StockTwits returned only a handful of messages, or one or more sources returned an "<unavailable>" placeholder, the sentiment read is less robust — flag this caveat explicitly. If the sources are silent on a given subreddit, say so.

5. **Identify catalysts and risks** that emerge across sources — product launches, competitive threats, macro headlines, etc.

6. **Past sentiment is not predictive.** Frame your conclusions as signal for the trader to weigh alongside fundamentals and technicals, not as a price call.

## Output

Produce a sentiment report covering, in order:

1. **Overall sentiment direction** — Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / Mixed — with a brief confidence note based on data quality and sample size.
2. **Source-by-source breakdown** — what each of StockTwits / Reddit is telling you, with specific evidence (cite message counts, ratios, notable posts).
3. **Divergences, alignments, and key narratives** across sources.
4. **Catalysts and risks** surfaced by the data.
5. **Markdown table** at the end summarizing key sentiment signals, their direction, source, and supporting evidence.
